# Face Recognition Based Attendance System with Face Authentication System

###How I build this project

Hello Everyone, Myself Aryan Jaiswal. I am a 2nd-year Undergrad Student in Computer Science and Engineering. I am pursuing my B.tech from the Kalinga Institute of Industrial Technology.
 
First of all, I would like to thank Microsoft for giving this great mentorship program. In this mentorship program, I have learned many things.
 
In the starting, I have no idea how to start because I have no more knowledge of development. Simply I start with python. Learn python as per requirement then I learned how to build a GUI application with Python Tkinter. Then I learned a little bit about some libraries such as OpenCV, Numpy, and Face Recognition. I have also learned about the MySQL database.
 
During building this project I have faced a lot of problems such as the installation process of all libraries, connecting with the database, how to use face recognition and how to store the face data etc.
But solving all the problems finally, I have built this project. Firstly, I build a Face Recognition based Attendance System then after that I decided to build a standard Authentication system using face recognition. Then after building authentication, I attached it with Face Recognition based Attendance System.
